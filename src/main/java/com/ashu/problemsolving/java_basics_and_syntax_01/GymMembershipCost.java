 * Title: Gym Membership Cost Calculator
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Problem:
 * A gym offers three types of memberships:
 *   - Basic: ₹1000/month
 *   - Premium: ₹1500/month
 *   - VIP: ₹2500/month
 * Discounts:
 *   - If the membership is for more than 6 months → 10% off
 *   - If the membership is for more than 12 months → 20% off
 *
 * Input:
 *   - Membership type ("Basic", "Premium", "VIP")
 *   - Number of months
 *
 * Output:
 *   - Total cost after applying discounts.
 *
 * Why This Problem is Interesting:
 *   Tests conditional logic, string handling, and basic math 
 *   operations — common in e-commerce and subscription systems.
