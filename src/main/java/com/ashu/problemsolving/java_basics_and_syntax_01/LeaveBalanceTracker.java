 * Title: Employee Leave Balance Tracker

 * Problem:
 * Each employee starts the year with 30 leave days.
 * Leaves are deducted as they are taken.

 * Input:
 *   - Starting balance (30)
 *   - List of leaves taken (full or half days)
 *
 * Output:
 *   - Remaining leave balance
 *
 * Why This Problem is Interesting:

 *   business logic found in HR systems.
