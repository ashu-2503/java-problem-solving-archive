 * Title: Calculate Annual Employee Bonus
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Problem:
 * A company provides an annual bonus to employees based on
 * their years of service. The rule is:
 *   - 0-1 years: No bonus
 *   - 2-4 years: 5% of annual salary
 *   - 5+ years: 10% of annual salary
 *
 * Input:
 *   - Employee name (String)
 *   - Years of service (int)
 *   - Annual salary (double)
 *
 * Output:
 *   - Print: "Employee: <name> | Bonus: <calculated bonus>"
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   - Years of service must be >= 0
 *   - Salary must be > 0
 *
 * Why This Problem is Interesting:
 *   This problem simulates real-world HR calculations and
 *   requires conditional logic, formatted output, and input
 *   validation â€” skills directly transferable to enterprise
 *   systems.
