 * Title: Display Shift-Based Greeting for Employees
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Problem:
 * An employee logs into the company portal, and the system
 * greets them based on the time of day:
 *   - Morning shift (6 AM to 2 PM): "Good Morning, <Name>"
 *   - Evening shift (2 PM to 10 PM): "Good Evening, <Name>"
 *   - Night shift (10 PM to 6 AM): "Good Night, <Name>"
 *
 * Input:
 *   - Employee name (String)
 *   - Login time (24-hour format, int)
 *
 * Output:
 *   - Appropriate greeting.
 *
 * Why This Problem is Interesting:
 *   Combines conditional logic, user input, and time-based
 *   business logic. Relevant for internal HR and ERP systems.
