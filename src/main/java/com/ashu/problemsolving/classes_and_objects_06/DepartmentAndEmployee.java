 * Title: Department and Employee Aggregation
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Problem:
 * Design Department and Employee classes.
 * A Department aggregates multiple Employees.
 * Implement methods to add employee and calculate average salary.
 *
 * Input:
 *   - Employee details (name, salary)
 *   - Department info
 *
 * Output:
 *   - Department summary and average salary
 *
 * Example:
 *   - Dept: IT, Employees: Alice(50k), Bob(60k) → Avg salary: 55k
 *   - Dept: HR, no employees → Avg salary: 0
 *
 * Why This Problem is Interesting:
 *   Demonstrates aggregation, object lists, and calculations.
