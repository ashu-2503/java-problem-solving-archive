 * Title: Cafeteria Menu Selector
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Problem:
 * A cafeteria has meals priced differently for categories:
 *   - Student: 50% discount
 *   - Staff: 20% discount
 *   - Guest: No discount
 * Additionally, add a 10% tax on final price.
 * Compute final payable amount based on category and base price.
 *
 * Input:
 *   - Base price (double)
 *   - Category (String: "Student","Staff","Guest")
 *
 * Output:
 *   - Final amount after discount and tax
 *
 * Example:
 *   - Input: 100, "Student"
 *     Output: 55.0
 *   - Input: 200, "Guest"
 *     Output: 220.0
 *
 * Why This Problem is Interesting:
 *   Multiple conditional branches + real-world pricing logic.
