 * Title: Inventory Reorder Alert
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Problem:
 * For a warehouse, check all product quantities and flag 
 * items that fall below the reorder threshold. 
 * Generate a report of products to reorder.
 *
 * Input:
 *   - List of products with current stock and reorder threshold
 *
 * Output:
 *   - List of products that need reordering
 *
 * Example:
 *   - Input: Product A (10/20), Product B (50/30)
 *     Output: Product A needs reorder
 *   - Input: Product C (5/5), Product D (6/6)
 *     Output: Product C needs reorder
 *
 * Why This Problem is Interesting:
 *   Combines loops, conditional checks, and reporting logic â€” 
 *   mirrors inventory management systems in industry.
